# Branch-Office-Network-Lab
Design a small Cisco-based branch network using one router and one switch, with separate VLANs for Admin/IT, Finance, HR, and Customer Service, each having wireless access.
## Objective
- Learn and implement static routing across multiple routers.
- Verify connectivity using ping and troubleshooting techniques.

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Microsoft Word (documentation)
- Screenshots / Images for topology and ping tests

## Commands Used
- Vlan
- DHCP
-  Inter-Vlan
- ping


## Testing & Verification
- Ping tests between Device to Device.
- Show Vlan Brief

## Files
- Branch Office Lab.pkt → Packet Tracer file
-Branch-Office-lab-Documentation.pdf → Step-by-step guide
- Screenshots/ → Ping test results, Vlan configurations

## Observations / Challenges
-VLAN configuration and inter-VLAN routing were critical to allow communication between all departments.
-DHCP and wireless setup required proper VLAN-to-interface mapping to ensure automatic IP assignment and seamless connectivity.
